## SUPERPOOONG

The idea was to create a multiplayer pong game where the game runs on multiple devices, connects the players to a lobby and lets them play against each other for the highest score.

To play locally [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) needs to be installed on your computer.

Start server by writing in the command line `node server.js`

Current version online on Heroku: [https://multiscreenapp.herokuapp.com/](https://multiscreenapp.herokuapp.com/)
